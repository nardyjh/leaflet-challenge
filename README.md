# USGS Earthquake Visualization

## Overview

The USGS Earthquake Visualization project offers an interactive map-based representation of earthquake data collected by the United States Geological Survey (USGS). This tool provides a means to visualize and explore earthquake events, offering insights into their magnitudes, depths, and locations globally.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run the visualization locally, ensure you have the following dependencies:

- Leaflet 
- D3.js 

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nardyjh/leaflet-challenge.git
    ```

2. Open index.html in a web browser to view the earthquake visualization.

## Features

- Map Representation: Utilizes Leaflet to display earthquake events on an interactive map.

- Marker Styling: Markers are sized based on earthquake magnitude, and colors represent the depth, with darker shades indicating greater depth.

- Popups: Clickable markers provide detailed information about each earthquake.
